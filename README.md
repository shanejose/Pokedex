# Pokedex
Pokemon is cult classic video game introduced in the 1990s. In these games, there are different creatures, called pokemon, that a player can catch, collect, train, and battle with. Each of these pokemon have different names, weights, heights, attack/defenses, abilities, etc. Because of this complexity, there is a lot of information surrounding each pokemon, and all that data needs to be kept track of somewhere. The in-game solution to store this data is the pokedex.
